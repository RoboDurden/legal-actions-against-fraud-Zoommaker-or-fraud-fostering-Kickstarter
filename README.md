# legal-actions-against-fraud-Zoommaker-or-fraud-fostering-Kickstarter
We fight for better crowdfunding and sincerly wish that Kickstarer joins.

# @all, spread the word to ensure a good starting momentum for the upcoming $2500 campaign.

We have chosen Github to honor the global open source community - and we see Crowdfunding as a likewise essential part of new born Information Society !

#  We(!) are fully transparent !

Strategy will be that when we finally enter court, we have already won because Kickstarter by then has fully proven their ignorant behavior that is fostering fraud:

1. **done** - set Kickstarter a deadline to hand out Zoommakers contact detail.
3. todo - set Kickstarter a deadline to inform all backers of the fraudulent update \#5
2. **done** - $250 funding from 11 Zoomaker backers.
3. todo - $2.500 campaign on Kickstarter and on a competing crowdfunding platform.
4. todo - ask 4 successful (2+ campaigns) and trusted Chinese creators to ask their 12.322 backers for support.
5. todo - file criminal complaints to make a prosecutor claim Zoomakers contact details from Kickstarter.
6. todo - Verify these contact details in Hongkong to file a criminal complaint there. (only from now on at least several $100 are needed)
7. todo - if contact details are invalid, file a civil action against Kickstarter: compensation for damages / loss suffered.
9. todo - If Kickstarter denies, file a criminal complaint against Kickstarter for partner in crime.
10. todo - File a $30 million civil action against Kickstarter because their system is rigged to allow fraudulent campaigns get away so Kickstarter can keep their commission without damaging their reputation.

Every failing campaign sooner or later gets into the 'scam zone' where they no longer follow the rule of transparency and deceive their backers with fraudulent updates.

When every backer of a failed tech campaign would only donate $1, we could raise a few hundred thousand US dollars !

So our basic strategy is to grow bigger and bigger.

Not to kill Kickstarter but to make it a better place !

We all want crazy campaigns and Kickstarter wants to be "The Wild West Of Crowdfunding" to foster creativity.

But fostering fraud is in itself fraud.

# @all, spread the word to ensure a good starting momentum for the upcoming $2500 campaign.
