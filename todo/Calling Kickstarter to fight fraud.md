# We are prompting Kickstarter to adopt some of the following proposals to make Kickster a better place:

If we indeed will have to drag Kickstarter to court then they will have to explain why they have rejected all the obviously good proposals of their own community !

* **When 10+ backers have commented in the last 7 days and 50% of them give a 'thumbs up' to a post, then Kickstarter will send an update/newsletter to all backers with a copy of these comments.**
This will foster an active backer opposition and no longer let only the creator mislead his inexperienced backers.

* **all 200+% over-funded campaigns should only receive their 100% funding goal and the rest when the first batch has been delivered.**
Then with the 747% Zoommaker campaign Kickstarter would have been able to issue a 86% refund and 100% backers would only have suffered a 14% loss = totally acceptable.

* **backers can add $5 to their pledge and when a seperate $1.000 goal is reached, Kickstarter will order an independent certificate of the creators credibility and capability**
Zoommaker refused to tell his identity. An independent consultant could have checked him and still prevent the reputed "malicious targeting by their competitors."

* **when 48 hours before a campaigns end an unusual lot of backers have canceled their pledge, Kickstarter will send an update to all backers with the comments of these backers.** 
This will foster the needed opposition of experienced backers and help the majority of naive backers who do not follow the comment section.
